title: "Bev Sedley, diet"

I can’t eat/drink shellfish, milk and its products, wheat, tea (apart from herbal teas) or coffee.

I also follow the Hay diet, a food-combining diet which means that I can’t eat high carbohydrate and high protein in the same meal.

- **High carbohydrate** 
foods such as potatoes and rice.
- **High protein** 
all meats (including chicken and fish), eggs and tofu.

This means I can’t eat paella or other dishes in which the two components are hard to separate.

In other cases, though, it’s perfectly easy for me simply to eat the meat/egg/fish/tofu and leave the rice/potato, or vice versa. I can eat green vegetables, salads, carrots, sweetcorn, fruit etc. with either protein or carbohydrate.

(Sorry!)
