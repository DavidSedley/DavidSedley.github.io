Adjusting the content on this site is not so difficult, but it requires a bit of setup. I will guide you through the different setup steps without much explanation, because it is only required once and really not so interesting.

## Create an SSH-Key
If you do not have an SSH-Key (or don't know what that is), you need one. Follow the steps in [this article](https://www.drupal.org/node/1070130) to create your private SSH-Key.

## Send me the public part of your key
The same article explains how to get the public key to your clipboard, so you can simply paste it into an Email that you send to me. This is a common procedure and since you keep the private part of your key for yourself, there is no security issue here.

I will then use your key to grant you access to the "playground" I've prepared here.

## Get a proper editor
No offense, but most people type in MS-Word and that is really not helpful here. So head over to https://atom.io/ to download and install the Atom Editor.
