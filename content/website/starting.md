The easiest way to change to content of this site might be to edit it online.

Fortunately the source code is hosted at GitHub which supports this kind of collaboration.

## Preparation
- Go to https://github.com and create an account (or let me know if I should do that for you)
- Check your incoming email to verify your GitHub account
- Tell me your username so I can add you as a collaborator to the playground-project

## Change content
- Go to https://github.com/halfdane/dsedley/blob/master/content/frontpage.md
- Click the edit-button: ![edit file button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.png)
- Change something in the page (but please don't touch the stuff at the top between the --- )
- Click the green "Commit changes" button - you can add a commit message in the fields above, but that's not necessary
- Wait a minute or two while your changes are used to generate the HTML
- Check http://halfdane.github.io/dsedley/ for your changes

The official documentation to editing content online is here: https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/
