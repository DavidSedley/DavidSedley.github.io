The easiest way to change to content of this site might be to edit it online.

Fortunately the source code is hosted at GitHub which supports this kind of collaboration.

## Preparation
- Go to https://github.com and create an account (or let me know if I should do that for you)
- Check your incoming email to verify your GitHub account
- Tell me your username so I can add you as a collaborator to the playground-project

## First steps to changing content
- Go to https://github.com/halfdane/dsedley/blob/master/content/frontpage.md
- Click the edit-button: ![edit file button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.png)
- Change something in the page (but please don't touch the stuff at the top between the --- )
- Click the green "Commit changes" button - you can add a commit message in the fields above, but that's not necessary
- Wait a minute or two while your changes are used to generate the HTML
- Check http://halfdane.github.io/dsedley/ for your changes

The official documentation to editing content online is here: https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/

## Further exploration
All content of the playground is under https://github.com/halfdane/dsedley/tree/master/content

I organized the files like they are in the menu on http://halfdane.github.io/dsedley and the files and directories resemble loosely the entries in the menu.

So to adjust the higher education of your curriculum, which is in the menu in "Curriculum Vitae"->"Higher Education", open the `curriculum` directory, click the file `education.md` and make the changes as described above. 

Have a look around in the files and directories. Since all changes are recorded by GitHub, it is always possible to go back to an older version. It helps to have meaningful commit messages, but it is possible without.
